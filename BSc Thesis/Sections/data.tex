\section{The Human Connectome Project \textit{(HCP)}}

\glsreset{T2w}
The data handled in this project has been amassed through the \gls{HCP}. The \gls{HCP} was an ambitious five-year effort to characterize brain connectivity and function and their variability in healthy adults. A consortium of investigators studied a population of 1200 subjects, using multiple imaging modalities along with extensive behavioral and genetic data. The imaging modalities included \gls{dMRI}, \gls{r-fMRI}, \gls{t-fMRI}, \gls{T1w} and \gls{T2w} \gls{MRI} for structural and myelin mapping, plus combined \gls{MEG} and \gls{EEG}. 

During the first phase, the WU-Minn \gls{HCP} consortium made a major effort to improve the methods of data acquisition and analysis, since up to that point in time, despite their great promise, all of the modalities that could be applied to \textit{in vivo} human \gls{connectomics} had serious limitations in their sensitivity, accuracy and resolution \cite{VanEssen2012}. This initial phase was followed by a three-year period of data acquisition from the main cohort \cite{HCP}.
% Describing the cohort subjects
A key objective was to understand inter-individual variability of brain circuits, including its genetic bases and its relation to behavior, rather than merely aiming to determine the average, or typical connectivity in healthy adults. This was achieved by sampling more than three hundred young adult sibships of average size 3-4, with most of these including a \gls{MZ} or \gls{DZ} twin pair. All subjects were between 22 and 35 years old, an age range chosen to represent healthy adults beyond the age of major neurodevelopmental changes and before the onset of neurodegenerative changes. While the \gls{HCP} was cross-sectional, many participants were drawn from ongoing longitudinal studies \cite{Sartor2011, Edens2010}; they had extensive previous assessment, particularly with respect to history of the presence or absence of emotional and behavioral problems.

% Methods of HCP
As for the methods, \autoref{fig:HCP_plan} provides a high-level view of the plans used for data acquisition in Phase II of the project. Each subject spent two days at \gls{WashU} for: behavioral assessment, whose measures spanned a broad range in the domains of cognition, emotion, perception and motor function and they were mainly drawn from the \gls{USA} \gls{NIH} but were supplemented by a number of complementary additional measures, blood draw for eventual genotyping, and four \gls{MR} scanning sessions, with three lasting one hour. The scans at \gls{WashU} were carried out using a customized \SI{3}{\tesla} connectome scanner adapted from Siemens Skyra, designed to improve the quality and resolution of connectivity data; a subset of 200 subjects was also scanned at \gls{UMinn} using a new \SI{7}{\tesla} system which offers advantages, especially for the resting and task-based fMRI studies, but also for diffusion-based techniques if sufficiently short echo times can be achieved for diffusion weighting. Both systems capitalized on major improvement in advanced \gls{MR} pulse sequences to obtain \gls{dMRI}, \gls{r-fMRI}, and \gls{t-fMRI}, plus \gls{T1w} and \gls{T2w} anatomical scans. The \gls{t-fMRI} scans incluced a range of tasks aimed at providing broad coverage of the brain and identifying as many functionally distinct domains and cortical parcels as possible. A subset of 100 subjects was also studied with combined \gls{MEG} and \gls{EEG} at \gls{SLU}, which offer much better temporal resolutions (\si{\milli\second} instead of \si{\second}) but lower spatial resolution than \gls{MR}. 

\subsection{Task-fMRI Battery of the HCP}

% Generic goal of HCP t-fMRI tasks
The \gls{HCP} used \gls{t-fMRI} to help delineate the relationships between individual differences in the neurobiological substrates of mental processing and both functional and structural connectivity \cite{Barch2013}. We know that there are important individual differences in suh patterns of connectivity even among persons with no diagnosable neurological or psychiatric disorders, and there is increasing evidence that this variablity is associated with alterations in cognitive and behavioral variables that constrain real world function \cite{Basset2009, Song2008, Heuvel2009}. For example, higher \gls{IQ} among healthy adults is associated with shorter path length and higher global efficiency in measures of brain functional connectivity \cite{Li2009} as well as greater global connectivity in prefrontal cortex \cite{Cole2012}, thus providing evidence that more efficient connectivity contributes to more effective congitive function. As another example, developmental research is increasingly suggesting that maturation of functional and structural networks in the human brain underlies key aspects of cognitive and emotional development \cite{Fair2007, Fair2009, Hwang2013, Imperati2011, Stevens2009, Supekar2009, Zuo2010}.

% What measures were assessed and what the task design and selection was based on
The goal for the \gls{HCP} was to identify and utilize a reliable and well-validated battery of measures that assess a wide range of human functions and behaviors in a reasonable amount of time (3-4\si{\hour}), to satisfy subject burden considerations. The base for the \gls{HCP}'s  assessment was the set tools and methods developed by the \gls{NIH} Toolbox of Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral function \cite{NIH_Toolbox}, including tasks developed and validated using item response theory and computer adaptive testing where appropriate and feasible. The battery was additionally expanded with tests to include measures of the following domains not covered by the Toolbox: 1) subthreshold symptoms of mood, anxiety and substance abuse; 2) additional measures of visual, memory and emotion processing; 3) personality; 4) delay discounting, as a measure of self-regulation and neuroeconomic decision making \cite{Dalley2008, Shamosh2008}; 5) fluid intelligence as a measure of higher-order relational reasoning that has been linked to important individual differences in both life function and brain function \cite{Burgess2011}; 6) menstrual cycle and hormonal function for women; and 7) sleep funciton, which may be highly relevant to understanding individual differences in behavior.

% Goal of the tasks
The choice of \gls{t-fMRI} tasks was driven by the following considerations. The aim was to identify nodes: 1) in well-characterized neural systems; 2) in as wide a range of neural systems as possible; 3) with activation locations that are reliable over time in individual subjects; 4) with activations consistently detectable in most individuals (sensitivity); and 5) that are asscosiated with a broad range of cognitive and affective processes of interest to the \gls{NIH} Blueprint Institutes. In addition, it was necessary that a subset of the tasks must be suitable for \gls{T-MEG}.

% Domains the tasks cover
Initial piloting targeted a broad range of domains that sampled diverse neural systems of interest to a wide range of individuals in the field, including: 1) visual and somatosensory-motor systems; 2) category-specific representations; 3) language function (semantic and phonological processing); 4) attention systems; 5) working memory/cognitive control systems; 6) emotion processing; 7) decision-making/reward processing; and 8) episodic memory systems.

\subsection{Working Memory Task of the HCP}

% How the experiment was conducted.
The data which is presently being examined was drawn from the \gls{WM}-task which was combined with category-specific representation tasks into the following, single task paradigm \cite{HCP_Task}. One can ignore stimulus type and focus on only memory load comparisons to identify dorsal-frontal and parietal regions involved in working memory and cognitive control. Alternatively, one can collapse across memory load and focus only on stimulus type comparisons to identify temporal, occipital and parietal regions that respond to specific stimulus types.

\end{wrapfigure}

Stimuli were projected onto a computer screen behind the subject's head within the imaging chamber. The screen was viewed by a mirror positioned approximately \SI{8}{\centi\meter} above the subject's face. Participants were presented with blocks of trials that consisted of pictures of places, tools, faces and body parts (non-mutilated parts of bodies with no "nudity"). Within each run, the four different stimulus types were presented in seperate blocks. Also, within each run, half of the blocks use a 2-Back \gls{WM}-task and half use a 0-Back \gls{WM}-task (as a working memory comparison). In short, in "N-Back" tasks participants are presented a sequence of stimuli one-by-one. For each stimulus, they need to decide if the stimulus currently being displayed, belongs to the same category as the one presented \textit{N} trials before. The factors that influence performance are not only the number \textit{N}, but also the speed of presentation and the size of the set of stimuli. A \SI{2.5}{\second} cue indicated the task type (and target for 0-Back) at the start of the block. Each of the two runs contained eight task blocks (10 trials of \SI{2.5}{\second} each, for \SI{25}{\second}) and four fixation blocks (\SI{15}{\second}). On each trial, the stimulus is presented for \SI{2}{\second}, followed by a \SI{500}{\milli\second} \gls{ITI}. The procedure is showcased in time order in \autoref{fig:WM_mat}.

The following event-related contrasts can potentially be gererated between 2-Back and 0-Back tasks: 1) targets for the first are 2-Back repeats while for the second, they are targets that match the cue stimulus; 2) non-targets are novel items for the former and targets that do not match the cue stimulus for the latter; and 3) lures are 1-Back and 3-Back repeats for the 2-Back tasks and repeated stimuli that do not match the cue stimulus, for 0-Back tasks.

% Segway to MVPA
The task design outlined above is expected to reveal distinct patterns of behavior, performance, and consequently brain activation among subjects. While there will be considerable overlap in these patterns, analysis can isolate the unique aspects, resulting in consistent and distinguishable \gls{fMRI} signal from specific brain areas in response to category-specific stimuli. This pattern recognition and screening from the selection of patterns that stood out, could enable the classification of certain brain regions as more responsive and associated with processing specific types of information.

\section{Analysis of fMRI Signal} %maybe analysis tools section, subsection mvpa, classification

% Explaining the main elements manipulated during analyses.
In the analysis of \gls{fMRI} signals, the primary output is a samples-by-features data matrix, similar in structure to conventional table matrices with rows and columns. Each feature represents a voxel in the brain image, and their maximum number depends on the protocol used during the \gls{fMRI} scan, determined by the institution that collected the data, not by the data users. Samples are created based on the researcher's design of the analysis. Each vector of data over multiple voxels for a single sample is called a pattern, and each cell contains information that integrates the \gls{BOLD} signal data as well as the researcher's analysis parameters.

% From BOLD to statistical value.
The \gls{BOLD} signal captured by the \gls{fMRI} machine undergoes a series of processing steps unique to each analysis, resulting in varied outcomes. These outcomes are shaped by the researcher's choices, which are tailored to address the specific goals and inquiries of the research. These processing steps, which will \textbf{((give a link to the section once written))} be detailed in a later section of this paper, replace the \gls{BOLD} in each cell of the data matrix with a statistical value that reflects both the signal's characteristics and the reasearcher's decisions.

% Multi-dimensional problem and attributes.
At first glance, a samples-by-features matrix might seem to represent a two-dimensional analysis, but it is far more intricate. Each cell may contain data points that incorporate a single or multiple \gls{EVs} meaninng each data point can be a function of several variables instead of it rather than a constant for each voxel. Additionally, sample attributes can further increase the number of variables included. These attributes, which function as headers of either rows, columns or the entire table include crucial information such as the target stimulus that produced the corresponding pattern, and the chunk to which the pattern belongs. Patterns from different chunks are considered independent of each other. Researchers may designate sample attributes differently based on logical assumptions, which can yield different practical conclusions and potentially increase the degrees of freedom in the analysis. Such a practice is shown in detail in \textbf{((link to 1vs4vs8 chunks))}. 

%Noteably, another attribute which should be explained is that of ds.a.vol.mat. affine matrix

% Introduction to COPEs.
Apart from technical decisions in data processing, the two main levers that can be manipulated are: 1) determining how many of the total \gls{EVs} provided by the experiment design to include in the analysis and whether some variables can be grouped together based on the desired effect; and 2) establishing the correlation between these \gls{EVs}.

\subsection{Univariate Pattern Analysis}

\gls{UPA} is a statistical approach used in neuroimaging to analyze brain activity data, particularly focusing on individual voxels. This method examines each voxel independently, assessing how its activity varies in response to different experimental conditions. Essentially, \gls{UPA} measures the magnitude of an individual \gls{EV} in each voxel.

For example, consider analyzing brain activity during all 0-Back trials featuring a face as a stimulus, with the only \gls{EV} being the stimulus category. This analysis might show activation in both the optic nerve and the \gls{FFA} during these trials. However, it cannot conclusively determine that these areas are more responsive to this stimulus category. By averaging the signal for this case and for three other identical \gls{UPA}s with different stimulus categories, one might conclude that the optic nerve, showing similar activation across all categories, is not involved in category-specific information processing but is generally activated when the subject observes anything. Nevertheless, this claim would be weak, as \gls{UPA} cannot distinguish what percentage of the signal magnitude is directly due to the stimulus category versus other factors.

\gls{UPA} is straightforward and widely used due to its simplicity and ease of interpretation. It is particularly useful when incorporating a time element into the assessment, as the calculations for a more complex analysis over time can become excessive. However, \gls{UPA} does not account for interactions between voxels, which can limit its ability to detect complex brain activity patterns and can lead to false or weak classification of brain activity patterns. Despite this limitation, \gls{UPA} remains a valuable tool for identifying localized brain responses and establishing a baseline for more complex analyses.

\subsection{Multivariate Pattern Analysis \textit{(MVPA)}}

A more appropriate tool for complex analyses and concrete conslusion would be \gls{MVPA}.
